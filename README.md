<h2>Password Generator</h2>
<p><i>This Python script is a basic password generator. It allows users to specify how many passwords they want and the desired length for each. The generated passwords are a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, with some characters randomly replaced by numbers and others converted to uppercase. The program ensures a minimum password length of 3 characters. The generated passwords are then displayed to the user.</i></p>
